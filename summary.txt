Summary of Changes and Important Notes:
New Models & DTOs:

Resume.java: Stores resume content and metadata.
JobDescription.java: Stores job details.
AnalysisResult.java: Stores the comprehensive analysis outcome for persistence.
ResumeUploadResponse.java: For responses to resume uploads.
JobDescriptionRequest.java/JobDescriptionResponse.java: For job description CRUD.
AnalysisRequest.java: For requesting an analysis by resume/job IDs.
AnalysisResponse.java: Updated to include strengths, weaknesses, recommendations as per your Angular AnalysisResponse interface.
AnalysisResultResponse.java: For showing simplified analysis results on the dashboard.
Firebase/Firestore Simulation:

FirebaseService.java: This is a simulated Firestore service using in-memory ConcurrentHashMaps. It's designed to let the application compile and run without needing a real Firebase project setup or Admin SDK credentials immediately.
Crucial for Production: For a real production application, you would replace the in-memory logic in FirebaseService with calls to the Firebase Admin SDK (after adding firebase-admin dependency to pom.xml and configuring a service account key).
The Repository classes (ResumeRepository, JobDescriptionRepository, AnalysisResultRepository) now use this FirebaseService for data operations, keeping the business logic layer clean.
New Services:

ResumeService.java: Handles resume-specific logic, including calling FileTextExtractor.
JobDescriptionService.java: Handles job description CRUD operations.
AnalysisService.java: Handles CRUD operations for saved analysis results.
ResumeAnalyzerService.java: Enhanced to include a second LLM call (via generateQualitativeAnalysis method) to generate strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations based on the overall analysis.
New Controllers:

ResumeController.java: Handles /api/resumes/upload (for file upload), /api/resumes/{id} (GET, DELETE).
JobDescriptionController.java: Handles /api/jobs (POST, GET), /api/jobs/{id} (GET, PUT, DELETE).
AnalysisController.java: Handles /api/analysis (POST to initiate analysis, GET for historical results), /api/analysis/{id} (GET, DELETE).
File Text Extraction Utility:

FileTextExtractor.java: A new utility class responsible for extracting text from different file types (.pdf implemented, .docx and .doc are simulated with placeholders).
Action Required: You MUST implement the actual text extraction logic for DOCX and DOC files using Apache POI, and add the corresponding POI dependencies to your pom.xml if you need real parsing for these formats.
pom.xml:

Added commons-fileupload for CommonsMultipartResolver.
Added apache.pdfbox for PDF text extraction.
Commented out apache.poi dependencies, which you'll need if you implement DOC/DOCX parsing.
application.properties:

Ensures gemini.api.url and gemini.api.key are configured. Remember to replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key.
To Get This Backend Running:
Download/Create Project: If you haven't already, create a new Spring Boot project (e.g., using Spring Initializr, selecting Java 17 and Spring Web dependency).
Organize Files: Place each .java file into its correct package directory under src/main/java/com/resumeanalyzer. Place pom.xml at the root and application.properties in src/main/resources.
Update API Key: Open src/main/resources/application.properties and replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key.
Build: Open your terminal in the project root and run mvn clean install.
Run: Execute mvn spring-boot:run from the terminal, or run the ResumeAnalyzerApplication.java file directly from your IDE.
